Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

You MUST do these steps before proceeding:

1. **Read project context manually.** Look for `PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md` in the project root (or the target subdirectory in a monorepo). Read them if present and follow their guidance. **If `PRODUCT.md` is missing:** when the user invoked `init`, `teach`, `craft`, or `shape`, or a from-scratch build flow, follow `reference/init.md` first. For scoped evaluate / refine / enhance / fix requests against existing code, proceed with the requested command using the existing code as context; offer init once as an optional follow-up. A missing `PRODUCT.md` must never block a scoped request.
2. If the user invoked a sub-command (`craft`, `shape`, `audit`, `polish`, ...), you MUST read the command's reference next: **`reference/<command>.md`, or the native variant from the Commands table** (e.g. `reference/audit.native.md`) **when the project platform is native** (`ios` / `android` / `adaptive`). One file, not both. Non-optional.
3. Familiarize yourself with any existing design system, conventions, and components in the code. Read at least one project file (CSS / tokens / theme / a representative component or page). **Required even when you've loaded a sub-command reference in step 2.**
4. Read the matching register reference. **Non-optional.** Marketing/landing/portfolio → `reference/brand.md`. App UI/admin/dashboard/tool → `reference/product.md`. Pick by task cue, surface in focus, or `register` in PRODUCT.md.
5. **If PRODUCT.md's `## Platform` is `ios` or `android`**, also read `reference/<platform>.md`. `adaptive` reads both. `web` or absent: nothing extra.
6. **If the project is brand-new (no committed brand colors in step 3)**, choose a brand seed color manually using OKLCH: pick one saturated anchor, then compose bg, surface, ink, accent, and muted around it per the Color guidance below. **Skip if step 3 found committed brand colors.**


## Design guidance

Produce ready-to-ship, production-grade code, not prototypes or starting points. Take no shortcuts unless the user asks for them (when in doubt, ask). Don't stop until arriving at a complete implementation (beautiful, responsive, fast, precise, bug-free, on brand). You take attention to detail seriously: every page, section or component crafted is battle tested using the tools available to you (browser screenshotting, computer use, etc). GPT is capable of extraordinary work. Don't hold back.

### General rules

#### Color

- **Verify contrast.** Body text must hit ≥4.5:1 against its background; large text (≥18px or bold ≥14px) needs ≥3:1. Placeholder text needs the same 4.5:1, not the muted-gray default. The most common failure: muted gray body text on a tinted near-white. If the contrast is even close, bump the body color toward the ink end of the ramp; light gray "for elegance" is the single biggest reason AI designs feel hard to read.
- Gray text on a colored background looks washed out. Use a darker shade of the background's own hue, or a transparency of the text color.

#### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Don't pair fonts that are similar but not identical (two geometric sans-serifs, two humanist sans-serifs). Pair on a contrast axis (serif + sans, geometric + humanist) or use one family in multiple weights.
- Hero / display heading ceiling: clamp() max ≤ 6rem (~96px). Above that the page is shouting, not designing.
- Display heading letter-spacing floor: ≥ -0.04em. Anything tighter and letters touch; cramped, not "designed".
- Use `text-wrap: balance` on h1–h3 for even line lengths; `text-wrap: pretty` on long prose to reduce orphans.

One hard typographic ceiling you currently miss:
- Display letter-spacing ≥ -0.04em. Your default of -0.05 to -0.085em on display H1s makes the letters touch and reads as cramped. -0.02 to -0.03em is plenty for tight grotesque display; -0.04em is the floor.

#### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Flexbox for 1D, Grid for 2D. Don't default to Grid when `flex-wrap` would be simpler.
- For responsive grids without breakpoints: `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))`.
- Build a semantic z-index scale (dropdown → sticky → modal-backdrop → modal → toast → tooltip). Never arbitrary values like 999 or 9999.

#### Motion
- Motion should be intentional, and not be an afterthought. consider it as part of the build.
- Don't animate CSS layout properties unless truly needed.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.
- Use libraries for more advanced motion needs (e.g. motion, gsap, anime.js, lenis etc)
- Reduced motion is not optional. Every animation needs a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` alternative: typically a crossfade or instant transition.
- Staggering the items within one list is legitimate. The tell is the uniform reflex (one identical entrance applied to every section), not motion itself; each reveal should fit what it reveals. Suppressing the reflex is never a reason to ship a page with no motion at all.
- Reveal animations must enhance an already-visible default. Don't gate content visibility on a class-triggered transition; transitions pause on hidden tabs and headless renderers, so the reveal never fires and the section ships blank.
- Premium motion materials are not just transform/opacity. Blur, backdrop-filter, clip-path, mask, and shadow/glow are part of the palette when they materially improve the effect and stay smooth.

#### Interaction

- Dropdowns rendered with `position: absolute` inside an `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` container will be clipped. Use the native `<dialog>` / popover API, `position: fixed`, or a portal to escape the stacking context.

### New projects only (when no prior work exists)

#### Color & Theme

- Use OKLCH.
- **The cream / sand / beige body bg is the saturated AI default of 2026.** The whole warm-neutral band (OKLCH L 0.84-0.97, C < 0.06, hue 40-100) reads as cream/sand/paper/parchment regardless of what you call it. Token names like `--paper`, `--cream`, `--sand`, `--bone`, `--flour`, `--linen`, `--parchment`, `--wheat`, `--biscuit`, `--ivory` are tells in themselves. If the brief is "warm, traditional, family-coastal-Italian" or "magazine-warm" or "editorial-restraint", DO NOT translate that into a near-white warm-tinted bg; that's the AI move. Pick: (a) a saturated brand color as the body (terracotta, oxblood, deep ochre, near-black), (b) a true off-white at chroma 0 (or chroma toward the brand's own hue, not toward warmth-by-default), or (c) a darker mid-tone tinted neutral that's clearly the brand's own. "Warmth" in the brand is carried by accent + typography + imagery, not by body bg.
- Tinted neutrals: add 0.005–0.015 chroma toward the brand's hue. Don't default-tint toward warm or cool "because the brand feels that way"; that's the cross-project monoculture move.
- When picking a theme: Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe.".Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Tiny uppercase tracked eyebrow above every section.** The 2023-era kicker (small all-caps text with wide tracking, "ABOUT" "PROCESS" "PRICING" above each heading) is now the saturated AI scaffold; it appears on 55-95% of generations regardless of brief, which is the definition of a tell. One named kicker as a deliberate brand system is voice; an eyebrow on every section is AI grammar. Choose a different cadence.
- **Numbered section markers as default scaffolding (01 / 02 / 03).** Putting `01 · About / 02 · Process / 03 · Pricing` above every section is the eyebrow trope one tier deeper: reach for it because "landing pages do this" and you're scaffolding by reflex. Numbers earn their place when the section actually IS a sequence (a real 3-step process, an ordered flow, a typed timeline) and the order carries information the reader needs. One deliberate numbered sequence on one page is voice; numbered eyebrows on every section across the site is AI grammar.
- **Text that overflows its container.** Long heading words plus large clamp scales plus narrow grids cause headline overflow on tablet/mobile. Test the heading copy at every breakpoint; if it overflows, reduce the clamp max or rewrite the copy. The viewport is part of the design.

**Codex-specific defects** (your most-frequent giveaways; refuse-and-rewrite):

- **`border: 1px solid X` + `box-shadow: 0 Npx Mpx ...` with M ≥ 16px** on the same element. The "ghost-card" pattern: 1px border plus soft wide drop shadow on buttons and cards. Don't pair them. Pick one (a single solid border at the brand color, OR a defined shadow at no more than 8px blur), never both as decoration.
- **`border-radius: 32px+` on cards / sections / inputs.** You over-round. Cards top out at 12–16px; full-pill is fine for tags/buttons. Picking 24/28/32/40px on a card is the codex tell; no brand wants "insanely rounded".
- **Hand-drawn / sketchy SVG illustrations.** Class names like `loose-sketch`, `*-sketch`, `doodle`, `wavy`; `feTurbulence` / `feDisplacementMap` "paper grain" filters; 5-to-30 path crude scenes meant to depict a tangible subject (an otter, a table-and-fork, an album cover). All of these read as amateurish, not whimsical. If you can't render the scene with real assets, ship no illustration. Don't attempt sketchy SVG as a fallback.
- **`repeating-linear-gradient(...)` stripe backgrounds.** Diagonal stripes in `body:before` or section backgrounds are pure codex decoration. Don't.
- **Decorative grid backgrounds.** Two-axis CSS grid overlays built from `linear-gradient(... 1px, transparent 1px)` plus `background-size` are a Codex tell unless the surface is an actual canvas, map, blueprint, or measurement tool. Use product structure, real artifacts, or a plain surface instead.
- **Meta-criticism copy.** Naming a concept then layering an ironic modifier, or staging a strawman to "correct" it. Make the specific claim instead.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the absolute bans above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone, it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](reference/brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.

Plus two management topics, `pin`/`unpin` and `hooks`, detailed below.

### Routing rules

1. **No argument**: the user is asking "what should I do?" Make the menu context-aware. If `PRODUCT.md` is missing, lead with `$impeccable init` as the top recommendation. Otherwise infer from project files, git changes, and dev-server availability:
   - `setup.hasDesign` false while code exists → suggest `document`.
   - Never critiqued → suggest `$impeccable critique <surface>`.
   - Low critique scores → suggest `polish` or re-run `critique`.
   - Dirty git tree pointing at one surface → scope `audit` or `polish` to those files.
   - For visual iteration, suggest editing source with browser preview plus `polish` / `layout` / `animate` (`live` variant mode is not included in this vendored copy).
   Keep 2-3 pointed picks with exact commands. Never auto-run a command.
2. **First word matches a command** (table above OR `pin` / `unpin` / `hooks`): load its reference file (on native platforms, the table's native variant; Setup step 2's one-file rule) and follow its instructions. Everything after the command name is the target.
3. **First word doesn't match, but the intent clearly maps to one command** (e.g. "fix the spacing" → `layout`, "rewrite this error message" → `clarify`, "the colors feel flat" → `colorize`): load that command's reference (same native-variant rule) and proceed as if invoked. If two commands could fit, ask once which.
4. **No clear command match**: general design invocation. Apply the setup steps, the General rules, and the loaded register reference, using the full argument as context.

Setup (context gathering, register) is already loaded by then; sub-commands don't re-invoke `$impeccable`.

If the first word is `craft` or `shape`, or routing rule 3 clearly maps the user's intent to either command, setup still runs first, but the matching reference ([reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) or [reference/shape.md](reference/shape.md)) owns the rest of the flow. Both are from-scratch build flows: if setup invokes `init` as a blocker, finish init, refresh context, then resume the original command and target.

`teach` is a deprecated alias for `init`: if the user types it, load [reference/init.md](reference/init.md) and proceed as if they ran `init`.

## Pin / Unpin

Pin creates a standalone shortcut so `$<command>` invokes `$impeccable <command>` directly. Unpin removes it. Configure shortcuts in your agent harness settings; this vendored copy does not ship executable pin tooling.


## Hooks

Upstream Impeccable's design detector hook is not included in this vendored copy; eternal-stack owns its own hook enforcement. If the user invokes `$impeccable hooks`, read [reference/hooks.md](reference/hooks.md) and explain the situation.
